function [X_poly] = polyFeatures(X, p)
%POLYFEATURES Maps X (1D vector) into the p-th power
%   [X_poly] = POLYFEATURES(X, p) takes a data matrix X (size m x 1) and
%   maps each example into its polynomial features where
%   X_poly(i, :) = [X(i) X(i).^2 X(i).^3 ...  X(i).^p];
%


% You need to return the following variables correctly.
X_poly = zeros(numel(X), p);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Given a vector X, return a matrix X_poly where the p-th 
%               column of X contains the values of X to the p-th power.
%
% 

%loop through 1 to p
for i = 1 : p,
    %now create the potence of each value of X with the corresponding
    %value of i and populate the X_poly array with it.  
	X_poly(: , i) = X.^i;
